# Datacamp : Prediction of subventions allocated to projects in the city of Paris.

Here we propose a challenge, that is to predict the subventions allocated by the Parisian townhouse to a given project. The description of the challenge and the data is available in the notebook. The data are available at https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/subventions-accordees-et-refusees.

In the submission folder, we propose a baseline for the challenge. The baseline is compatible with ramp servers.
